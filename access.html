								<h2>ACCESS</h2>
								<p>Access to the two gates of the Garden is provided by electronic key fob.</p>
								
									<h4>USING THE GATES</h4>
									<p>The <b>NORTH GATE IS NOW FULLY AUTOMATED</b>. When activated by a keyfob on the re-positioned keyfob pads (on the gate post on entering and on the new control cabinet on leaving) the gate automatically opens, stays open for 15 seconds, then closes. The opening and closing is at a stately pace, please be patient and allow it to open and close by itself. <b>To avoid breaking the gate mechanism PLEASE DO NOT PUSH OR PULL THE NORTH GATE.</b></p>
									
									<p>The <b>SOUTH GATE does not benefit from an automated opening</b>. After activation by a keyfob please manually open the south gate. The gate will automatically close on it's own.</p>
									
									<h4>WHEELCHAIR ACCESS</h4>
									<p>Please use the gate on the northern side of the garden. This gate is fully automated and offers level access to the garden from the pavement.<br>
									There are no steps or obstacles on the pathway through the garden.</p>

								<hr />

								<h2>HOW TO OBTAIN A KEY FOB</h2>
								
									<h4>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</h4>
									<p><blockquote><b>Access to the Garden is regulated by the <b><a href="https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/laws_kia_abridged_0402221.pdf" <span class="label">Kensington Improvement Act 1851</span></a></b> as implemented by the Garden Subcommittee. Two groups of residents of Earls Court Square may apply for keyfob access to the garden:</b></blockquote></p>

									<p><b>1. Garden Charge-payers</b>, who have a legal right to garden access. These are all owners and long-term tenants who pay the Garden Charge with their Council Tax in the properties fronting the garden enclosure, i.e. the following addresses:<br>
										• odd numbers 17-31 and 51-69 Earl’s Court Square<br>
										• even numbers 12-26 and 30-52 Earl’s Court Square<br>
										• Herbert Court Mansions<br>
										• Matière Place (33 &amp; 33A Earl’s Court Square and Flats Number 6, 12, 21, 25 &amp; 31 at 35-37 Earl’s Court Square)</p>
										
									<p><b>2. Garden Subscribers</b>, who do not have a legal right of access to the garden but may be granted a yearly licence subject to availability and at the discretion of the Garden Subcommittee acting on the vote of Garden Charge-payers at the AGM.<br> Council tax payers living in Earl’s Court Square outside the Garden Charge-paying area at the following addresses may apply to become subscription-paying key fob holders:<br>
										• odd numbers 1-15 and 45 Earl’s Court Square<br>
										• even numbers 2-6 Earl’s Court Square<br>
										• Northgate House<br>
										• Langham Mansions<br>
										• Wetherby Mansions<br>
										• Matière Place (except for the flat numbers listed in the point above)<br>
										• Farnell Mews<br></p>
										
									<p>Check above to see if you are eligible for Garden access. Ineligible applications will not be accepted.<br><br>
										
									<u>No new key fobs are now being issued to Garden Subscribers until further notice but interested residents can be added to a waiting list.</u></p>
