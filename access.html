								<h2>ACCESS</h2>
								<p>Access to the two gates of the Garden is provided by electronic key fob.</p>
								
									<h4>USING THE GATES</h4>
									<p>The <b>NORTH GATE IS NOW FULLY AUTOMATED</b>. When activated by a keyfob on the re-positioned keyfob pads (on the gate post on entering and on the new control cabinet on leaving) the gate automatically opens, stays open for 15 seconds, then closes. The opening and closing is at a stately pace, please be patient and allow it to open and close by itself. <b>To avoid breaking the gate mechanism PLEASE DO NOT PUSH OR PULL THE NORTH GATE.</b></p>
									
									<p>The <b>SOUTH GATE does not benefit from an automated opening</b>. After activation by a keyfob please manually open the south gate. The gate will automatically close on it's own.</p>
									
									<h4>WHEELCHAIR ACCESS</h4>
									<p>Please use the gate on the northern side of the garden. This gate is fully automated and offers level access to the garden from the pavement.<br>
									There are no steps or obstacles on the pathway through the garden.</p>

									<h4>2024 FEES</h4>
									<p>Garden Charge-payers: £60 initial non-refundable administration fee only.</p>
									<p>Garden Subscribers:<br>
									• The fee for the first year is currently £285 made up of the annual fee of £225 p.a. plus administration fee of £60. The key fobs run annually from April 1st to March 31st.<br>
									• For those applying after October 1st, half fees will be charged i.e. £112.50, plus an administration fee of £60 giving a total of £172.50.<br>
									• There is no automatic right to renew a subscription. Currently the Garden Committee encourages renewals.<br>
									• Existing subscribers will be sent an email invitation in March to renew their subscription by 31st March. Renewals cannot be processed prior. <b>*RENEWAL INVITATIONS FOR 24-25 were sent to all current subscribers on 16th March 2024*</b><br>
									• As of 2024 we require renewals to confirm their continued eligibility by re-submitting their photo ID and new council tax bill for the next financial year. For example, those renewing in March 2024 for the subscription period April 2024-March 2025 would need to submit their council tax bill for the period April 2024 to March 2025. This can be done using the online application form.<br>
									• Failure to renew by 31st March will cancel subscriber status and lead to key fob de-activation. <b>*THE RENEWAL DEADLINE FOR 24-25 <u>ONLY</u> HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 7TH APRIL 2024*</b><br>
