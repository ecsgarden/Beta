								<h2>Our Garden</h2>
								<p>This award-winning garden was originally laid out as part of the Edwardes Estate in the 1870s, and was well managed with an almost full -time gardener until 1939.  However, in the Second World War the original cast iron railings were removed and five emergency water tanks filled the southern half of the garden.  From 1945 until the early 1970s it was neglected and overgrown, surrounded by green wire netting.<br>
									In the mid 1970s the newly-formed Residents’ Association, spearheaded by life-long Earl’s Court Square resident, campaigner and <i>bonne viveuse</i /> Jennifer Ware (1932-2019), brought the garden under the 1851 Kensington Improvement Act.  Landscape gardener and resident Christopher Fair designed the present layout.  The established London plane trees were pruned and maintained properly but one on the south side was blown down in the October 1987 ‘hurricane’. We have several other mature varieties, including a rare elm and sycamore.<br><br>
								  The standard of our garden maintenance and improvement in recent decades led to a first prize in the Brighter Kensington &amp; Chelsea Scheme competition.  A children’s play area was added in 1980.<br><br>
									In recent times the garden has been host to many neighbourhood social events, including a very popular annual summer BBQ, a Christmas tree lighting party, and several soirées musicales during the summer months.<br>

								<h2>Our Square</h2>
								<p>The grand stuccoed terraces in the late Italianate-style on three sides of the Square are complemented by the Grade II* listed Dutch-style red brick houses on the south side.  In the early 1970s part of the Square was in danger of being torn down and replaced with still higher density housing.  However this was averted when the Square was designated a Conservation Area.  Since 1997, the last  remaining hostels, from the time when Earl’s Court was known as ‘Kangaroo Valley’ as home to arriving young Australians such as Germaine Greer and Clive James, have been converted into flats.<br>

							<h2>LATEST NEWS</h2>
								<h3 style="color:#32fdcd";>GARDEN USE IS SUBJECT TO STRICT ADHERENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST CORONAVIRUS LEGISLATION</h3>
								<h3>Lawns</h3>
								<p>Please note that the lawn areas have been fenced off for maintenance for 6 weeks<br> 
								while we aerate, fertilise and reseed in readiness for summer.</p>
								<h3>AGM 2021</h3>
								<p>The Annual General Meeting of the Earl’s Court Square Garden Committee was held on 14 January 2021 by Zoom and proxy vote. A reduced Garden Charge was set following a Covid-19 attributed under-spend on the garden and heavy demand for garden access from Garden subscribers. The Garden Subcommittee is now increased by the election of Sarah Wadey and Cilla Ware.</p>
								<h3> Dutch Elm Disease</h3>
								<p>The Garden Subcommittee unfortunately has to report that Dutch elm disease infested the wych elm tree in the south-east corner of the garden. One large, diseased branch was removed and with the diagnosis confirmed, the Council authorised and directed the removal of the rest of the tree as soon as possible. This is very sad but unavoidable. Tree surgeons removed the tree in July and injected the stump with the recommended pesticide. It will be dug out completely in due course.</p>
