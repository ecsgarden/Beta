										<h2>Garden Byelaws</h2>
											<p>Like all other Garden Squares and public parks, we have to have rules to ensure the quiet enjoyment of the garden by residents as well as to ensure the quiet of the residents of the Square is not disturbed. We welcome children into the Garden to play, as long as accompanied by a responsible key holder, and are proud of our special children’s playground, which we believe was the first of its kind in a Kensington Garden Square.</p>
											<b>By applying for a key fob for access, the resident is deemed to have read and accepted the byelaws below.</b></p>
											<h4>ACCESS MAY BE SUSPENDED FOR ANY RESIDENT FOUND TO BE BREACHING THE BYELAWS AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE BYELAWS ARE ENFORCEABLE AND MAY BE PROSECUTED IN THE COURTS, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A COURT CONVICTION, CRIMINAL RECORD AND FINE.</h4>
